# ITCS_4232
This is my project for ITCS 4232. It's a Doom 2 Modification!

Here is what you need to know about running the Mod.

First things first you are going to need a copy of the DOOM II iwad. If you don't have that I will leave a submission comment on Canvas.
WAD standing for Where's all the Data!

You will then need to install GZDoom:

After you have installed GZDoom put the executable with my file and the DOOM II iwad.
Now drag my modification on the executable and it should run. Enjoy my levels!

*Note
There may be a bug with the red door on the first level. My roommate got stuck on some geometry when testing out my tutorial level, however I did not encounter this issue when running through it multiple times. Should you encounter the issue do these steps:

Press the ~ button to pull the console up
Type in "noclip" or "no clip" to enable no clip and get through the door.

The rest of the levels should run just fine.
